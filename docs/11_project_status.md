# Project Status

## Snapshot
This document represents the current, authoritative state of the project.
All implementation, planning, and AI behavior should align with this reality.

---

## Overall Project Maturity
**Status:** Phase 2 In Progress - Meal Planner Mostly Complete ✅
**Code exists:** Infrastructure + pure functions + database + **All 9 Tools** + Working Auth Flow + **Recipe UI (Full CRUD)** + **Meal Planner (Week View + Add Meals)**
**Phase:** Phase 1 ✅ → Phase 2 (Tools ✅ → UI Scaffolding ✅ → Recipe Screens ✅ → Recipe Forms ✅ → Meal Planner ✅ → Polish next)

---

## Spec Completeness
**Assessment:** Mostly complete, minor gaps remain

Notes:
- Approximately a dozen spec files exist
- Core decisions around AI behavior, data ownership, workflows, and UI patterns are defined
- Remaining work is consolidation, polish, and execution planning

---

## Architecture Confidence
**Level:** Confident, only minor adjustments expected

Current direction:
- Responsive web application
- Serverless-compatible architecture
- Intended stack: Supabase + Vercel
- AI agent with deterministic tools + creative reasoning

Architecture is not fully locked but large shifts are not anticipated.

---

## UI / UX Definition
**Level:** Wireframes and visual direction mostly defined

Characteristics:
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Bottom navigation with iconography (calendar, recipes, groceries, chat)
- Clean, modern, mostly white, flat aesthetic
- Focus on simplicity over density

High-fidelity designs do not yet exist.

---

## AI Behavior & Governance
**Maturity:** Well-defined and intentional

Status:
- Clear separation of deterministic vs creative AI behavior
- Explicit autonomy boundaries
- Transparent memory and learning rules
- User-selectable AI role (Coach vs Collaborator)
- Failure handling and uncertainty policies defined

Specs are strong but not yet exercised in code.

**Completed (Step 3 - Supabase)**:
- ✅ Docker Desktop installed and running
- ✅ Supabase CLI installed (v2.67.1)
- ✅ Supabase project initialized
- ✅ Initial migration created (20251223161521_initial_schema.sql)

**Completed (Step 5 - Auth Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE)**:
- ✅ Playwright E2E testing configured
- ✅ @supabase/ssr package installed for Next.js App Router
- ✅ Supabase auth client utilities created:
  - Client-side: `lib/auth/supabase-client.ts` (cookie-based, anon key)
  - Server-side: `lib/auth/supabase-server.ts` (cookie-based, anon key)
- ✅ Server-side callback route (`app/auth/callback/route.ts`)
  - Uses `createServerClient` with proper cookie handling
  - Handles PKCE code exchange server-side
  - Redirects based on user state (onboarding vs planner)
- ✅ Authentication pages implemented:
  - `/login` - Email input with magic-link request
  - `/auth/callback` - Server-side route handler
  - `/onboarding` - Household creation for new users
  - `/planner` - Authenticated home with logout
- ✅ Server action pattern for authenticated writes (`app/onboarding/actions.ts`)
  - **Solution**: Uses service role key for DB writes (bypasses RLS safely)
  - Validates user authentication first (security preserved)
  - Pattern: Verify auth → Use elevated privileges for trusted operations
- ✅ RLS policies updated:
  - Household creation policy targets `authenticated` role
  - Two migrations applied: `20251223161521_initial_schema.sql`, `20251226103741_fix_household_creation_policy.sql`
- ✅ E2E test helpers created:
  - Mock email service with Mailpit integration
  - Database seeding utilities
- ✅ E2E authentication tests: **2/4 passing**
  - ✅ New user completes magic-link flow
  - ✅ Returning user logs in directly
  - ⏳ Expired token shows error (edge case)
  - ⏳ Reused token is rejected (edge case)
- ✅ Supabase SMTP configured for local email capture (Mailpit on port 54324)
- ✅ **Auth flow works end-to-end** (manual + automated tests)

**Completed (Phase 2 - All Tools ✅)**:

- ✅ AuthenticatedLayout component (auth check, header, logout)
- ✅ Placeholder screens for all tabs
- ✅ Mobile-first responsive design (viewport meta, proper spacing)

  - Grid layout: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack per day
  - Today's date highlighted
  - Empty state with CTA
  - Real-time meal display with recipe details
- ✅ Add meal flow (`/planner/add`)

  - ✅ Authentication flow (new user, returning user)
  - ⏸️ Auth edge cases (2 tests - expired/reused tokens, deferred)
  - 🐛 Recipe edit (1 test skipped - validation bug discovered)
- ✅ **Bug found**: Recipe edit PUT endpoint returns 400 (validation error)

**Next Steps**:
- 🐛 Debug recipe edit validation bug (PUT /api/recipes/:id returns 400)
- Remove meal functionality (click to delete)
- Grocery list UI (list selector, items, check off)
- Wire up action buttons (Add to Planner, Push to Grocery from recipe detail)
- Polish and refinements

**Not Started**:
- Agent SDK integration
- UI polish and components

---

## External Services Readiness
**Status:** Local development environment fully operational

- ✅ GitHub repository exists (local only, not pushed yet)
- ✅ Supabase local running (Docker containers)
  - Database: postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres
  - Studio: http://127.0.0.1:54323
  - API: http://127.0.0.1:54321
- ⏳ Vercel project (Phase 5+)

**Cloud Deployment Strategy Decided**:
- Agent SDK will run in Vercel API routes (not Supabase Edge Functions)
- Simpler deployment: Single Vercel project handles frontend + backend
- Supabase Cloud only for database + auth

---

## Hosting & Deployment Intent
**Current belief:** Local-first development, cloud later

Details:
- Day-to-day development will be local
- Architecture assumes eventual Supabase + Vercel deployment
- Cloud infrastructure will be introduced once core functionality is validated

This decision is revisitable.

---

## Privacy & Access Scope
**Audience:** Private household only (user + spouse)

Implications:
- Simple auth model
- No public access
- No multi-tenant complexity
- Focus on trust and reliability

---

## Data Importance
**Criticality:** Mission-critical

Rationale:
- Primary motivation is long-term ownership of data
- Must not be locked into vendors
- Requires:
  - Backups
  - Export paths
  - Migration safety
  - No silent data loss

---

## Initial Build Priority
**Primary focus:** Core CRUD

Order of importance:
1. Recipes
2. Meal planner
3. Grocery lists
4. Data integrity

AI experience is expected to feel “magic” once this foundation exists.

---

## Biggest Known Risk
**Risk:** Technical uncertainty (stack, hosting, auth)

Mitigation approach:
- Start with local-first development
- Introduce cloud infrastructure incrementally
- Avoid premature optimization
- Keep specs authoritative and current

---

## Summary
This project is intentionally paused at the planning boundary.
The goal is to:
- Reduce rework
- Preserve momentum
- Enable AI-assisted implementation without confusion

This file should be reviewed before any major build step.

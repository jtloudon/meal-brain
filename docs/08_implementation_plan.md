# 08 – Implementation Plan

**Authoritative execution roadmap for the MealBrain project.**

This plan constrains scope, sequences work, and prevents premature complexity.

---

## Guiding Principles

### Development Philosophy
- **Build the spine before the brain** - Data layer before AI intelligence
- **Data safety before delight** - Trust before polish
- **AI behavior must be trusted before it is impressive**
- **Each phase must be shippable on its own** - No throwaway work
- **Mobile-first, household-only** - Optimize for 2-user, private use case
- **Progress measured by confidence, not feature count**

### Technical Principles
- Develop locally first (Supabase local stack)
- Test-driven development for critical paths
- AI creativity for planning, deterministic Tools for mutations
- No vendor lock-in beyond convenience
- No premature optimization
- No silent AI behavior
- No irreversible actions without approval

---

## Success Metric

> **"This app is successful if my spouse has less frustration about meal planning."**

The MVP is complete when:
- Wife uses it without training
- Meals planned for a week
- Groceries generated correctly
- AI helps but never surprises

---

### Phase 2: Core CRUD & UI MVP
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks (part-time, ~20-30 hours)

**Goal**: App usable without AI. Manual data entry works perfectly.

#### Deliverables

**Recipe Management**:
- Recipe list screen (card grid, search, filter by tags)
- Recipe detail screen (ingredients, instructions, notes, rating)
- Recipe create/edit form (manual entry only, no voice/OCR yet)
- Implement Tools:
  - `recipe.create`
  - `recipe.update`
  - `recipe.get`
  - `recipe.list`

**Meal Planner**:
- Week view calendar (7 days, scrollable)
- Meal cards (title, tags, tap to view recipe)
- Add meal flow (select recipe → select date → select meal type)
- Remove meal action
- Implement Tools:
  - `planner.add_meal`
  - `planner.remove_meal`
  - `planner.list_meals`

**Grocery Lists**:
- List selector dropdown (multiple lists per household)
- Grocery item checklist (checkbox, quantity, unit)
- Create new list
- Manual add item
- Ingredient push modal (from recipe detail or planner)
  - Checklist of ingredients (all checked by default)
  - Target list selector
  - Preview aggregated quantities
  - Confirm button
- Implement Tools:
  - `grocery.create_list`
  - `grocery.add_item`
  - `grocery.push_ingredients` (deterministic aggregation)
  - `grocery.check_item`
  - `grocery.list_lists`
  - `grocery.get_list`

**UI Polish (Mobile-First)**:
- Responsive layout (375px-667px viewport)
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Bottom tab navigation fully functional
- Loading states for all async operations
- Error states with clear messages

**Testing**:
- Unit tests for quantity math
- Unit tests for ingredient aggregation logic
- Integration tests for all Tools (with test DB)
- E2E test: Auth flow
- E2E test: Create recipe → Add to planner → Generate grocery list

#### Phase 2 Success Criteria

**Must work flawlessly**:
- [ ] Create 5 recipes manually
- [ ] Plan a full week of meals
- [ ] Generate grocery list from planner
- [ ] Ingredient quantities aggregate correctly
- [ ] All CRUD operations reversible (soft delete)
- [ ] Wife can use without asking questions

**Exit Criteria**:
- App is fully functional without AI
- All core user flows work on mobile
- Test coverage >80% for Tools and business logic
- No critical bugs in manual workflows

---

### Phase 3: AI Agent (Creative, Read-Only First)
**Duration**: 1 week (part-time, ~10-12 hours)

**Goal**: Creativity without risk. AI can suggest but not mutate.

#### Deliverables

**AI Chat Panel**:
- Slide-up drawer overlay (50% viewport height)
- Text input + Send button
- Message bubbles (user left, AI right)
- Context awareness (knows current screen)
- Dismissible (swipe down or tap outside)

**Agent SDK Integration**:
- Initialize Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet client
- Implement Agent orchestration layer
- Intent classification (what does user want?)
- Provide read-only Tools to agent:
  - `recipe.list`
  - `recipe.get`
  - `planner.list_meals`
  - `grocery.list_lists`

**Creative AI Capabilities**:
- Answer questions: "What recipes do I have with chicken?"
- Suggest meals: "Suggest a dairy-free dinner"
- Plan weeks: "Plan meals for next week" (preview only, no writes yet)
- Reason about variety: "What haven't we had in 2 weeks?"

**No writes allowed yet** - AI can only read data and propose ideas.

#### Phase 3 Success Criteria

**Must work**:
- [ ] AI can answer questions about existing data
- [ ] AI proposes meal plans (preview only)
- [ ] AI explains reasoning clearly
- [ ] AI never attempts to mutate data
- [ ] Chat panel works smoothly on mobile

**Exit Criteria**:
- AI reads data correctly via Tools
- AI provides helpful suggestions
- User trusts AI responses (no hallucinations about data)

---

### Phase 4: Deterministic Tool Writes (Approved Actions)
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks (part-time, ~15-20 hours)

**Goal**: Safe AI actions. AI can propose + execute with approval.

#### Deliverables

**Tool Confirmation Flow**:
- AI proposes action with preview
- User sees confirmation modal:
  - What will happen (e.g., "Add 3 meals to planner")
  - Which data will change
  - Approve / Cancel buttons
- On approve → Tool executes → AI confirms result
- On cancel → AI acknowledges cancellation

**Write Tools for Agent**:
- `recipe.create` (from AI-suggested recipe)
- `planner.add_meal` (from AI meal plan)
- `grocery.push_ingredients` (from AI suggestion)

**AI Workflows**:
- "Plan this week for me" → AI proposes 7 meals → User approves → Tools execute
- "Add ingredients for Tuesday's dinner to grocery list" → AI shows preview → User approves → Tool executes
- "Create a recipe for chicken tikka masala" → AI drafts recipe → User edits → User confirms → Tool creates

**AI Governance Enforcement**:
- All writes require explicit approval
- AI explains what will happen before execution
- AI confirms what happened after execution
- User can undo within session

#### Phase 4 Success Criteria

**Must work**:
- [ ] AI can plan a week with user approval
- [ ] AI can generate grocery lists with user approval
- [ ] AI never writes without confirmation
- [ ] All writes are reversible
- [ ] User feels in control at all times

**Exit Criteria**:
- AI assists with planning end-to-end
- Approval flow is frictionless
- No surprise mutations
- Wife uses AI features confidently

**Goal**: Make the app delightful and reduce friction.

#### Potential Enhancements

**Voice Input** (Phase 5a):
- Web Speech API integration
- Mic button in chat panel
- Speech-to-text → AI processes text
- Requires user confirmation before writes

**OCR Recipe Import** (Phase 5b):
- Camera button in chat panel
- GPT-4 Vision or similar for OCR
- Extract recipe text → AI structures → User reviews → Tool creates
- Requires user confirmation before writes

**Advanced Planning** (Phase 5c):

---

## Development Workflow

### Daily Workflow
1. Work locally with `supabase start`
2. Run tests before committing (`npm run test`)
3. Commit to Git with descriptive messages
4. Push to GitHub when feature is stable
5. Deploy to cloud only after local validation

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests**: Pure functions (quantity math, validation, aggregation)
- **Integration tests**: Tools with test database
- **E2E tests**: Critical user flows (auth, planning, grocery generation)
- **AI behavior tests**: Prompt → expected tool calls

### Code Review
- Self-review checklist before commit:
  - [ ] Does it respect user control?
  - [ ] Does it ask before mutating state?
  - [ ] Is it reversible?
  - [ ] Does it explain reasoning?
  - [ ] Is it tested?
  - [ ] Does it work on mobile?

---

## Anti-Goals

### What We Will NOT Do

❌ **Premature optimization** - Solve performance issues when they exist, not before
❌ **Silent AI behavior** - AI never acts without user knowledge
❌ **Irreversible actions** - All mutations must be undoable
❌ **Vendor lock-in assumptions** - Stay portable where practical
❌ **Feature creep before MVP** - Defer nice-to-haves until core works
❌ **Desktop-first design** - Mobile is primary, desktop is bonus
❌ **Auto-learning without consent** - AI must ask before storing preferences
❌ **Complexity for elegance** - Simple working code beats elegant broken code

## Summary

This plan prioritizes:
- **Trust before cleverness** - Users must trust AI before it can be powerful
- **Structure before speed** - Solid foundation enables fast iteration later
- **Ownership before convenience** - User control always wins

**Progress is measured by confidence, not feature count.**

---

## Version History
- **v1.0** (2025-12-22): Consolidated from `08_project_plan.md` and `12_implementation_plan.md`. Updated to reflect Agent SDK architecture and simplified phase structure.

## Phase 2.5: Dev Login Implementation (BLOCKED - 2025-12-27)

### Status: BLOCKED
See `docs/17_dev_login_blocker.md` for details.

**Current Workaround:**
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/login
2. Enter `demo@mealbrain.app`, `spouse@mealbrain.app`, or `test@mealbrain.app`  
3. Check Mailpit: http://127.0.0.1:54324
4. Click magic link in email
5. Auto-links to seed data household (dev mode only)

**What Works:**
- ✅ Auth callback auto-links dev emails to Demo/Test households
- ✅ Seed data: Demo Household has 3 recipes
- ✅ Jest/Vitest tests work (programmatic auth)
- ✅ Playwright E2E tests work (Mailpit API)
- ✅ Production deployment unaffected

**What's Blocked:**
- ❌ Automated dev-login (no password/magic link/PKCE works in local Supabase)
- ❌ Dev-login E2E test (skip for now)

**Next Steps:**
- Option A: Continue with manual magic link (current)
- Option B: Implement custom auth bypass middleware (future)
- Option C: Debug Supabase local config (time intensive)
